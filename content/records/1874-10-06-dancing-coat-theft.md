Mr. Jonathan Botham, of Stanton-by-Dale, must be a most energetic dancer. Yesterday week, while in the dancing-room of the Stanhope Arms, Stanton-by-Dale, he pulled off his coat— not to fight, but to dance. Jonathan's coat, however, seems to have become indignant at being deprived of its share of the amusement, and danced away in quite an illegal manner, so that its owner had to go home in his dancing costume. The coat was found afterwards in a stable, and the partner of its dance, who had led it astray, was ascertained to have been a man named Wm. Miller, who declared that he had only been taking care of it. At Ripley Petty Sessions, yesterday, he was sentenced to one month's imprisonment with hard labour. Probably, after this occurrence, Mr. Botham will conform to the usage of society and dance with his coat on.
