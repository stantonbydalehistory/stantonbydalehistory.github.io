**OVERALLS MISSING**

**LONG EATON MAN ACCUSED OF THEFT**

Robert Charles Streets (19), a stenciller, of Derby-road, Lansdowne-grove, Long Eaton, was accused at an occasional court at Ilkeston to-day of stealing a pair of overalls valued at 1s. 9d., the property of George Albert Mee, of Tolls-avenue, Stapleford, on or between August 20 and 21.

He was remanded on bail in his own surety of £5 and a further surety of £5 until Ilkeston Sessions next Thursday.

Police-constable Vickers said that he received information from the Stanton Ironworks Co., Ltd., that a pair of overalls was missing from a box at their Spun Plant department at Stanton. He made inquiries and saw Streets, who was wearing a pair of blue overalls.

Streets, Police-constable Vickers alleged, said: "I bought these overalls at Long Eaton from Wakefield and Sons."

Police-constable Vickers added that, on examination of the overalls, he found a tab bearing the initials C.W.S. When charged, alleged the constable, Streets made no reply.

The magistrate was the Rev. A. Copley.
