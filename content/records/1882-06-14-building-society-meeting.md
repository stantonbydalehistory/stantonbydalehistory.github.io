**BUILDING SOCIETY.**—The annual meeting of the Erewash Valley Working Men's Mutual Benefit Building Society was held at the Rutland Arms Hotel, Ilkeston, on Wednesday night, when there was a fair attendance of members. Mr. Edwin Trueman, one of the trustees, was elected to the chair. The first business was the appropriation of a share of £150 by ballot, which fell to share No. 443, belonging to Mr. Henry Hall, Stanton-by-Dale. The Chairman then offered a share by auction, and after some spirited competition it was knocked down at a premium of £53.— The Secretary next read the auditor's report and balance sheet for the year ending May last, which was, on the whole, of a very satisfactory character. The report and balance sheet were adopted. Six gentlemen were elected on the committee in place of those retiring, and the names of those chosen were Messrs. W. Lee Page, Thos. Fowle, Thos. Straw, William Johnson, A. B. Wood, and Wm. Sleath.
