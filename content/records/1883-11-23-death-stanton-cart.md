**DREADFUL ACCIDENT AT STANTON-BY-DALE.**

About six o'clock on Wednesday evening, a man named George Course, living at New England, a district of Ilkeston, met with an accident, which terminated fatally.

He was in the employ of the Stanton Ironworks Company, and was returning from Derby with a load of glass, when it is believed that he overbalanced himself, fell off the cart, and was run over.

No one saw the accident, but the deceased was found lying dead on the road by police-constable Newton, who is stationed at Stanton.

His remains presented a shocking spectacle, for his cheek was badly crushed, and his right ear had been cut completely off.

The body was removed to the Stanhope Arms to await an inquest, which will be held this day (Friday), by Mr. Coroner Whiston.
