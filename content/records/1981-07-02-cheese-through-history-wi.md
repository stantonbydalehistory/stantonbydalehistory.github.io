## Cheese through history

At the June meeting [Stanton-by-Dale Women's Institute](/institution/womens-institute/) discovered the Greeks made cheese, it is mentioned in the Old Testament and the Romans marched on it! These and other facts from the history of cheese-making were divulged by Mr. Wyman, of the National Dairy Council.

Members saw slides illustrating aspects of dairy work both past and present, including an early milking machine — not, apparently, too popular with the cows! The making of Stilton cheese was shown and members enjoyed sampling that and eight other British cheeses.

Mrs. Hancock from Shipley WI reported on her visit as delegate to the monthly meeting of the National Federation of Women's Institutes at the Royal Albert Hall.

Stanton-by-Dale had acted as hostesses to a visiting institute from Abbey Gates on Monday, June 15. This had been a successful and friendly evening.
