**Retiring After 36 Years In Constabulary**

Supt. B. A. Bailey of "Markfield," Station-road, Mickleover, will retire soon from the Derbyshire Constabulary, in which he has been Superintendent and Chief Clerk at the County Police Headquarters, Derby, since April, 1922.

Supt. Bailey, whose late father was for many years a sergeant in the Derbyshire Constabulary, and whose mother lives at "Newry," Broadway, Ripley, joined the force on June 1, 1907.

Before coming to headquarters at Derby in 1912 he was stationed at New Sawley, Matlock Bath, Chesterfield, Shirebrook, Chesterfield, and Alfreton.

He was promoted to the rank of sergeant in 1914 and four years later became inspector.

Supt. Bailey's impending retirement from the force is particularly regretted because of the untiring work he has always done for various police funds.

He is hon. secretary of the Derbyshire Constabulary Mutual Assurance Association, the Police Benevolent Fund, and Police Widows and Orphans Fund, all of which have flourished considerably through his untiring efforts.

At the County Hall yesterday, in the presence of the superintendent of the Derbyshire Constabulary, and representatives of all ranks the Chief Constable, Mr. J. M. Garrow, presented Superintendent Bailey, on behalf of all ranks and ex-members of the Force with a cheque in recognition of his long service.

Among those present were the Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. W. Clarke, and other police officers, civilian members of headquarters staff, and representatives of Derby City and County Council.

**HIGH TRIBUTE**

The Chief Constable paid a high tribute to the work of Supt. Bailey during his long association with the Force, and made special reference to the good work he had done for the various Police Funds.

Inspector H. C. Clark (Chesterfield) and Constable H. Vickers (Stanton-by-Dale) endorsed the Chief Constable's remarks, and added their good wishes to Supt. Bailey in his retirement.

Supt. Bailey will retire at the end of the month and his successor has yet to be appointed.

His eldest son, Sidney, is a Squadron Leader in the R.A.F. and is an Old Bemrosian.
