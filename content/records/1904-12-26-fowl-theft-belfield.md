**ALLEGED THEFT OF FOWLS AT  
STANTON-BY-DALE.**

This morning, before Ald. W. Merry, at Ilkeston Town Hall, Chas. Belfield, labourer, of 4, Clinton-terrace, Cotmanhay, was charged with stealing nine fowls, value 25s., the property of Mr. Richard Dick Scattergood, of the Stanhope Arms, Stanton-by-Dale, between November 26th and 27th. Prosecutor said he locked his fowls up at night, and on going to the field the following morning he found nine missing from the roost. Snow had fallen, and he could trace footprints.

Mr. Harrison, of South-street, Ilkeston, said he bought twelve fowls from defendant. The golden Hamburg cockerel (produced in court) was included in the number of birds.

Inspector Payne arrested prisoner in Bath-street the previous evening, and in reply to the charge of stealing the fowls Belfield replied, “No, I have never been in that country.” The man was placed in the company of nine others, and Harrison identified prisoner without difficulty. There was another charge of stealing a fowl from some person unknown, but the inspector had no evidence to offer.

Prisoner was remanded to Ilkeston Petty Sessions, bail being allowed. He said he was a married man with seven children, and had been employed at the corn stores, Shipley, for 18 months.
