**LICENSEE DIES MONTH AFTER RETIREMENT**

ONLY a month after he retired, Mr. Ernest Palmer, former licensee of the Stanhope Arms, Stanton-by-Dale, has died, aged 69.

Mr. Palmer was licensee of the Seven Oaks Inn, which is in the centre of Stanton Ironworks, for 11 years. He worked at the ironworks for many years.

He played cricket and bowls for the works' teams and was later a member of Erewash Valley Golf Club.

Mr. Palmer's wife, Violet, formerly lived at Uttoxeter, where her parents and grandparents were licensees at the White Horse.

Mr. and Mrs. Palmer had lived at Rose Cottage, Dale Road, Stanton-by-Dale, since their retirement.

The funeral service tomorrow at St. Michael's Church, Stanton-by-Dale will be followed by cremation.
