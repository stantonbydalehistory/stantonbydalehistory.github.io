**ILKESTON DIVISION.**

On Monday Mr. E. Lumley, barrister-at-law, commenced the work of revising the lists of votes for the Ilkeston Division by holding a Court at the Red Lion Inn, Sandiacre, where the lists for the parishes of Sandiacre, Risley, and Stanton-by-Dale were dealt with. The Conservatives were represented by Mr. E. Trueman, and Mr. H Thorpe appeared for the Radicals. No special points of interest arose. The Radicals put on one owner and nine lodgers at Sandiacre, and struck off an occupier at Stanton-by-Dale who had received parish relief. The Conservatives added to the list one owner and two lodgers at Sandiacre, and three occupiers at Stanton-by-Dale.—A second Court was held in the afternoon at the White Hart Inn, Stanley, when the lists for the parishes of Mapperley, Stanley, West Hallam, and Dale Abbey were revised. The Conservatives had two lodger claims allowed, and the Radicals struck the name of Mr. Percy Payne, rating agent to the Midland Railway Company, off the West Hallam occupation list.—The revising barrister afterwards held an evening sitting at the Town Hall, Ilkeston.
