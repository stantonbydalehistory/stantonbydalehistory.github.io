At the annual meeting of the Stanton-by-Dale Association for the Prosecution of Felons, held on Thursday last at the Stanhope Arms, it was unanimously resolved that for the protection of property no expense should be spared in the detection and prosecution of offenders.

We cannot but be struck with this spirited determination when we are informed that the association of that parish has incurred considerable expense during an Assize trial, when a prisoner of the name of Wm. Oxley was sentenced to transportation for life for a burglary committed on one of its members.
