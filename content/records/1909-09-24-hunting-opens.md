**HUNTING OPENS.**

The meet of the Earl of Harrington's hounds on Saturday was at West Hallam Railway Station, and, although very few people assembled there, the field was later swelled into considerable proportions. Besides the Master (the Earl of Harrington) there were seen out Major and Mrs. D. Wilmot-Sitwell, Mr. H. D. Bayley, Mr. H. Crossey, Miss Sybil Mundy, Mr. H. W. T. Patterson, Mr. W. Eben Hardy, the Rev. C. J. Boden, the Misses Grace and Dorothy, and Marjory Hooley, Mr. B. J. F. Cooney, Mr. J. J. Hulse, Mr. Cedric Hulse, Mr. S. P. Piggin, Mr. Harry Piggin and Miss Piggin, Mrs. Bedford, Miss Jacobson, Miss Crossley, Mr. Philip Walker, Mr. A. H. Clarke, Mr. C. B. Cant, Mr. J. M. Briggs, Mr. Ralph Cowing, and the Misses J. and E. Cowing, Mr. A. Eardley, Mr. R. Bowmer, Mr. F. Bowmer, Mr. A. O. Fuller, Mr. Herrick Fuller, Mr. B. M. Sims, Mr. H. Thompson, Dr. D. E. V. Eames, Mr. M. W. Long, Mr. W. H. Richardson, Mr. D. Barber, and Mr. Baker.

Ladywood held several cubs, but the bracken was so dense that hounds could do little there. They broke cover at the bottom corner towards Stanton, but ere long he swung to the right, and after traversing the lower side of the cover re-entered his lair. After about half-an-hour's further work in cover a "view holloa" was given away on the Dale side, and hounds ran very prettily by Dale pit and over the road, as if for the Sand Quarry. Here, however, the many men at work headed the fox, and he ran for Dale Forge, before reaching which he swung round to the left and hounds were close on his back—one of the pack once rolled him over—he got to ground in a big rabbit hole close to Dale Abbey. No sooner had hounds been put into the Furnace Plantation at Stanton-by-Dale than a fox was away, and a smart burst ensued to Wood Barn. Here a brace of foxes were afoot, and hounds were halloaed on to one seen crossing the Stanton-by-Dale and Dale Abbey Road into Baggaley's Hills, but they could do nothing.
