**THE RESTORATION OF STANTON CHURCH.**

The ancient little church was re-opened on the 11th inst., having undergone a partial restoration, consisting chiefly in zemoving the inconvenient and unsightly square pews, and west gallery which blocked up the tower arch, taking away a singular wooden division betwixt the nave and chancel, and the very unsuitable communion rail.
The whole available space for the congregation has been fitted up with open benches, stained and varnished; a new pulpit, desk, communion rail, chancel door, &c., have also been added; the whole of the aisles and floor re-laid with Staffordshire tiles in alternate red and black; the corbals of the tower arch replaced by new ones (the old having been cut away for the convenience of gallery occupants) ; and an entire new chancel arch and wall with massive buttress has been introduced at its intersection with the nave.
A beautiful memorial window has been placed in the south side of the chancel by the Rev. S. Eversfield, the present curate, to the memory of his mother, and the nave also contains a window in memory of the late Earl Stanhope, given by the present rector.
The church consists of a small tower, nave, north aisle, chancel, and porch. The chancel and north aisle are plain but good
specimens of a village church about the time of the first Edward; the nave has been greatly mutilated, and contains windows of a much later date; the tower appears to have been built in the 16th century. The work has been executed from designs and under the superintendence of Mr. R. Bar-ber, of Eastwood, architect.
The contractors were Messrs.
Kerry and Allen, of Smalley, who have carried out the works in a very creditable and satisfactory manner.
The heating apparatus is by Mr. Mitchell, of Leamington.


We have unalloyed praise to bestow upon the general prineiples observed in this restoration
if we except the inartistie plastering of the interior.
This is unworthy the spirit and taste of the age, and is contrary to those purer principles of art which we had hoped were generally appre-ciated. The whole available space for the congregation has been filled up with open pine seats, stained and varnished, and accominodation is now furnished for 280 worshippers, being one hundred in excess of the number which could be seated previously, and many other details have been carried out so as to make the church suitable for the solemn purpose to which it has been set apart. The work has been executed at a cost of about £360.
Mr. Howard, the rector, bas been at the sole expense of the works in the chancel, but the Earl Stanhope was the largest contributor to the general restora-tion, and in this respect has set an example which has been liberally followed by the late Mrs. Everfield, Mr. Crompton, and other residents of the neighbourhood. The re-opening service commenced a few minutes before twelve, and the ancient temple of God was crowded by a large and influential congregation. The officiating ministers were the Revds. S. Eversfield (curate), J. L. Longmire, S. Hey, and J. G. Howard (the rector), who, we regret to say, only read the offertory sentences, on account of his weak state of health.
The preacher at the morning service was the Right Rev. Dr. Spencer, late Bishop of Madras.
He selected as his text John xv., 27—" Peace I leave with you, my peace I give anto you; not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid." A collection was made while the offertory sentences were read, and the handsome sum of £55 Os. 1d. was contributed. This will, we are glad to say, remove anxiety about the dis. charge of all liabilities.
Plates were held by Sir H. S. Wilmot, Bart., and the Hon. and Rev. F. Curzon. During the service the village choir were stationed in the tower, and were very ably accompanied by Mr. H. Farmer, of Notting-ham, on a splendid harmonium, kindly lent for the occasion.
The hymns sung were to the tunes—" Old Hundredth," "Costellow," and Kyrie, the chants, Purcell in G, to the Venite and Gtorias, and Robinson to the Jubilate; the Te Deum being sung to Jackson's service in F. The generous and catholic spirit which was so successfal at Alvaston in providing a luncheon in celebration of the opening of the schools in that village, was equally successfal at Stanton; and a large and distinguished party were invited to partake of the splendid hospitality offered by the clergy and the parishioners. The tables were laid-and heavily laden they were too-in the school-room, which was very appropriately decorated, and at the one end the words Pro aris et focis were executed in everygreens.
There were present the Right Honorable Earl Stanhope, the Countess Stanhope, and Lady Mary Stanhope; Sir H
S. Wilmot, Bart.; R. E. E. Wilmot, Esq., and the Misses Wilmot; Right Rev. Lord Bishop Spencer; Mrs. and Miss Spencer; E. S. Chandos Pole, Esq., and Mrs. Pole; W. D Lowe, Esq., and Miss Lowe; Hon. and Rev. F. Curzon;
Hon. Mrs. Curzon; Hon. and Rev. C. J. Willoughby and Mrs. Willoughby; J. S. Sherwin, Esg., and Mrs. Sherwin; the Revs. E. Poole (Alvaston), Canon Brookes, W. Howard, W. Milton, S. Eversfield, J. C. Newdigate, A. Newdigate, J.
Erskine Clarke, S. Hey, J. Longmire, G. S. Ebsworth, J. B. Pugh, - Heslop, H. B. Frizell, C. Rawlins, M. H. Scott,
- Atkinson, J. Jowett, J. Casson, E. B. Wawn (son of the late Rev. J. D. Wawn, who was for twenty-four years incumbent of Stanley, and theological tutor in Cheltenham Grammar School); Mr. J. Canner, Mr. Hancock, C. G. Anderson, Esq., Mr. H. H. Bemrose, Mr. Porter, Mr. Salt, Mr. Cresswell, Mr. Doar, Mr. Haywood, and the majority of the farmers of his Lordship's Derbyshire estates.
Toasts followed and the Earl Stanhope delivered a speech concluding as follows:-For my own part I feel the greatest satisfaction in the present aspect of English country life. There must be exceptions of course in so large a community both in the owners and tillers of the soil, but as a general rule you will find English gentlemen loving to reside in their country houses intent upon the improvement and cal-tivation of their land, and you will find the tillers of the soil highly educated, no longer merely desirous of treading in the paths their fathers trod before them, but ever striking out new walks of improvement and driving sterility before them from the vale and from the hill, till it disappears beyond the summit of the bleakest and most distant pole. (Great cheering) England in the present day presents a
far higher, a nobler basis for our exertions than it ever did before, and that should incite and animate us to make renewed efforts. For my own part I thank you most cordially for the kindness with which you have received me and the patience with which you have heard me, and I hope you will forgive me if in attempting to express my thoughts upon these important matters I have detained you too long. (Cries of " No, no," and loud cheers.) At all events if I
have been too lengthy in my speech I will make amends by its close, and I will now venture, as an appropriate close to our proceedings to-day, to propose the health of a gentleman to whose anxious and unwearied exertions we are indebted for the completion of the work in which we have so bappily taken a part.
In proposing the health of my rev. friend on my right, Mr. Howard, who has been so forward in this work, and to whom its success is mainly attributable, I am sure I propose a toast which all who are interested in the well being of the church and of Stanton will drink with the greatest pleasure. (Loud and prolonged applause followed the conclusion of the noble Earl's speech.)
The Rev. CHAIRMAN acknowledged the toast by simply saying, "I thank you," and the party then separated.
On the departure of Lord Stanhope and his lady for Derby, a large crowd of ladies and gentlemen and villagers assembled round the carriages and loudly cheered the noble party; and amid these demonstrations of affection and
esteem, his Lordship drove off saying "It does my heart good to be so kindly received."
An admirable sermon was preached in the evening, by the
Incumbent of New Radford, the Rev. W. Milton.
The collection at the close of which amounted to £3 15g. 6gd.
Thursday afternoon was one of great festivity when about 300 were entertained at a substantial tea, furnished partly by the remains of the tables of the preceding day, aided by a munificent contribution by Lady Stanhope.
After which a very interesting address was delivered by the Rev. J. H. Pugh, Rector of Westbury, Salop, to his former parishioners, who was followed by a most amusing lecture of admirable tendency and very happily delivered by the Rev. M. H.
Scott. The whole being concluded by singing the doxology, heartile ioined in, with the pronouncing the blessing by the Rector.
