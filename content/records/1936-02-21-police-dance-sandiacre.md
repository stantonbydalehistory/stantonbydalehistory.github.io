**POLICE AS HOSTS**

**Five Hundred Dancers At Sandiacre Event**

Five hundred dancers were present at the Stanton Canteen on Friday night, when the maximum success attended the annual effort arranged by Police-Sergeant W. H. Land and the Sandiacre police in aid of the Derbyshire Constabulary Widows' and Orphans' Fund. The room was decorated gaily with coloured lights and variously tinted streamers and the donning of carnival hats by the guests intensified the sense of colour.

Mr. A. T. Davey, of Stanton-by-Dale, was the M.C., and amongst those present were Superintendent and Mrs. S. Richardson (Ilkeston), Superintendent and Mrs. Bailey (Derby), Superintendent Campbell (Alfreton), Inspector and Mrs. Bramhill (Dronfield), and Inspector and Mrs. Clarke (Ilkeston).

The prize-winners were Mr. and Mrs. Watson, Mrs. Fletcher, Mr. Wells, Mr. and Mrs. Trueman, Mrs. Heath, Mr. Cooney, Mrs. S. Richardson, Mrs. George, Mr. Palmer, Mr. Richardson, Mrs. Bostock, Mr. and Mrs. Thorpe, Miss Crook, Mr. V. Hallam and Miss Halford.

The duties of stewards were carried out by Police-Sergeant W. H. Land and Police-Constables Carter, Warton, Vickers, McClymont, Jess and P.c. Wallis.

Music was provided by the Belmont Dance Orchestra.

It is expected that the dance will result in the addition of £40 to the funds.
