**ILKESTON.**

**PETTY SESSIONS, May 22.—Before W. T. Cox, Esq., and Colonel Newdigate.**

**A DANGEROUS DOG.—**Samuel Storer, Heanor, was charged by Police-constable Gibson, Kimberley, with allowing a dangerous dog to go at large, and not under proper control, on the 8th.—It appeared that as the constable was passing defendant's house on the day named the dog rushed at him, and bit him on the leg,—Defendant was ordered to pay 13s. 6d. costs, and to keep the dog under proper restraint, otherwise he would be liable to a heavier penalty.

**DRUNKENNESS.—**Edwin Burrows, travelling groom, was charged with being drunk and quarrelsome, and refusing to quit the Stanhope Arms, at Stanton-by-Dale, on the 3rd of May.—Fined 10s., and 17s. 6d. costs, or a month.—Mary Ann Gee, a young woman, was charged with being drunk and riotous in Ilkeston Market-place, on the 7th.—Fined 10s., and 10s. 6d. costs, or fourteen days.—William Stone, a navvy, who works in the neighbourhood of Stanton Iron Works, was charged with the same offence at the same time and place.—Fined 5s., and 10s. 6d. costs, or seven days.—Defendant offered to pay both for himself and Gee, if the Bench would give him a fortnight, but this was refused, and both were removed to the lock-up.—Thomas Sudbury, lace-hand, Ilkeston, was charged with being drunk and riotous in the Ilkeston Market-place on the 4th of May.—Defendant denied being drunk, and said he was only standing in his own defence, in which statement he was corroborated by Henry Tunnicliffe, who said a man named Syson, after offering defendant various provocations, at last commenced "welting" at him right and left, when he only defended himself.—Fined 10s., and 10s. 6d. costs.
