**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

The annual exhibition of plants, flowers, fruits, and vegetables, in connection with the Stanton-by-Dale and Dale Abbey Floral and Horticultural Society, took place on Saturday in the grounds adjoining Stanton Hall, by kind permission of Mrs. George Crompton. There was keen competition in most of the classes, and the produce was of a very high quality. In the several classes for potatoes Amos Riley was either first or second in nearly the whole group; whilst D. Morrell was very close after him. In flowers, the extensive groups shown by Messrs. Small, Ilkeston, Fisher, Nottingham, and Mr. George W. Crompton, were admirably arranged. Mr. Henry Hall took first for hand bouquets. The judges were Mr. E. Branson (Trowell) and Mr. Ball (Bramcote). There was keen competition for the children's prizes in garden and wild flowers. A brass band contest was also held in connection with the show.
