## ACCIDENT TO NOTTINGHAM EXCURSIONISTS.

### AN OMNIBUS OVERTURNED.

On Tuesday afternoon a serious accident occurred between Stanton-by-Dale and Dale Abbey, near Ilkeston, by which several persons were badly injured. A party of women numbering 24, members of a guild in Nottingham, were out for a day's pleasure, and were riding in a brake, two men having charge of the horses. Approaching Dale Abbey is a sharp turn in the steep road, and at this point the brake turned completely over, the women being underneath. Their screams brought a number of inhabitants to the spot, and the passengers were extricated, but not without considerable difficulty. It was found that some were perfectly helpless and bleeding freely. Several Ilkeston surgeons were sent for, Dr. Tobin being first to arrive. By his advice some of the women were sent on to the Nottingham General Hospital, whilst several cases calling for urgent treatment were detained at Ilkeston. Others were sent in private conveyances to Nottingham. Two of the occupants of the brake, Mrs. Warsop, 42, Hunt-street, Gordon-road, and Mrs. Barnott, 23, Manchester-street, are suffering from slight concussion, and severe contusions. Drs. Watkins and Hill, of Nottingham, who were summoned and were quickly in attendance, have pronounced them free from broken limbs. A woman named Davis, of Nottingham, sustained slight internal injuries, and Mrs. Hillory, of Lomas-yard, Bellar-gate, is suffering from severe injuries and shock. Mrs. Knight, of Sabina-street, Great Alfred-street, is suffering from severe contusions of the head and arms. Several of the more severe cases are under surgical superintendence at the General Hospital.
