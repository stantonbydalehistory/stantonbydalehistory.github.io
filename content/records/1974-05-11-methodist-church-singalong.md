MEMBERS of Stanton-by-Dale Methodist Church are seen taking part in a Sankey Sponsored Singalong in aid of church funds.

The singalong started last night and will continue until 10 a.m. tomorrow. Members and friends hope to sing for 40 hours and so break the 251 hours record set up by Burton Youth Choir.

The singers were still going strong today, loud, tuneful, exhilarating—in spite of the hours behind them and the hours ahead.

"It is going extremely well," said one of the singers, Mrs Doris Barker. "Throughought the night there were never less than four people singing and often nine or ten."

By the time the singalong ends about 2,000 hymns will have been sung.
