**A BELGIAN REFUGEE IN TROUBLE AT STANTON.**

At Ilkeston to-day, Amandus Lifibori, a Belgian refugee, was charged by D. R. Scattergood, landlord of the Stanhope Arms, Stanton-by-Dale, with refusing to quit his licenced premises, and also with wilfully damaging a door and three glass tumblers, on December 27th.—Mr. Clifford (for Mr. F. G. Robinson) prosecuted, and Mr. Bates acted as interpreter.

It was stated that defendant was receiving a weekly wage of 30s. from Stanton Ironworks, and had house and coal free.

The charges were fully proved, and the Bench ordered a payment of 30s., the Mayor expressing an opinion that defendant ought to be fighting for his King and country.
