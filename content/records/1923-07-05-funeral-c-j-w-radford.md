## THE LATE MR. C. J. W. RADFORD.

The funeral of the late Mr. C. J. W. Radford took place on Tuesday at the Uttoxeter-road Cemetery Derby. The service was held in the cemetery chapel, and was impressively conducted by the [Rev. H. E. Kewley](/resident/h-e-kewley/), rector of Stanton-by-Dale. The late Mr. Radford in his early days was in business in Derby, and had lived in retirement at Stanton-by-Dale for over 20 years. He was highly respected, and his popularity was shown by the friends and acquaintances assembled at the church and graveside. The mourners were: Mr. and Mrs. C. Radford (Leeds), Mr. and Mrs. Woodward, Mrs. Perkins, Mr. and Mrs. Potts and son, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson (Stanton-by-Dale), Mrs. Green (Nottingham), Mr. Frank Radford and wife (Stanton), Mr. and Mrs. Pierce (Ripley), Mr. and Mrs. Penn (Ilkeston), Mr. Fred Radford (Derby) and Mr. and Mrs. S. Radford (Turnditch Hall). Many floral tributes were sent, including tokens from the grandchildren and friends at Stanton-by-Dale. The coffin was of polished oak, with brass fittings and nameplate, engraved "James Charles Watts Radford, at rest June 2nd, 1923, aged 76 years." The funeral arrangements were in the hands of Messrs. Wathall.
