A NEW and big venture is to be undertaken by the choirs of Dale Abbey Church and Stanton-by-Dale Church on Good Friday when they will combine to present the cantata "The City of Gold."

The Rector, the Rev. Walter Noy, says that because the choirs have never attempted anything quite as ambitious as this, he is rather anxious about the amount of practice they have lost during the past few weeks because of bad weather.

"I think, however, that we shall be ready in time," he adds.
