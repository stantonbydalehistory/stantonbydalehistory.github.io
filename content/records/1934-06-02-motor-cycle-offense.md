**'OVERLAY' PROVES COSTLY TO STAPLEFORD MAN**

At the Ilkeston police court on Thursday, Alfred B. Jackson, 190, Derby-road, Stapleford, labourer, was fined £1 for using a motor cycle without a Road Fund licence at Stanton-by-Dale, on March 3, and ordered to pay £1 costs for failing to put in force a policy of insurance.

P.C. Vickers stated that defendant said he used the cycle because he had overlaid and did not wish to be late for work.
