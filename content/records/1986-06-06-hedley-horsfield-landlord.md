**Hedley keeps up the family tradition**

HE'S following in father's footsteps — Mr Hedley Horsfield, that is, the landlord of the Stanhope Arms.

In taking over what is his first pub, set in the pretty and quiet village of Stanton-by-Dale, Hedley has carried on the family tradition.

His "dear old Dad" was a landlord in Nottingham and he was brought up in the trade.

But he trained as an engineer and worked in Stapleford before taking on his own pub.

**Landlord**

"My dad was a landlord and he later had an off-licence. I never really wanted to follow him, but I suppose the idea grew until I came here about 11 years ago," he said.

Hedley and his wife, Brenda, who does the dinners, have been keen on improving the place. When they moved in 18 months ago the pub was in a shabby state.

"It is surprising really. This place was very run down but surprisingly few people seemed to complain. They would come in for a drink because there was nowhere else to go, but it certainly wasn't a landlord's dream."

The pub's main room has been improved. "I don't know how people were happy to come into one. Little of the history of the building is known. The owners, Shipstones, would like to get the place on the National Register as a 300-year-old cottage.

"We've done a lot of work to have kept any of the modern features. One of our customers won a trip to Mexico dominating the World Cup competition, with the free trip attempting to ensure that interest does not fall away."

He has installed a television set for the locals. "Some local people come here for a drink and watch football on the big screen. It's a lot better than sitting at home for the match and come in for the second half or something.

"I think we should provide this service though.

"I just hope they leave us the 11 o'clock closing, especially if it's in England, otherwise we might have a few problems."

The pub has its own football team and supports the renowned bowls team based at Stanton.

The Stanhope Arms serves Shipstones beer, which is considered by some to be an 'acquired' taste. But Shippos fan Hedley says: "It's a very good drink, and good, strong quality. I drink it!"

By the end of my visit, Hedley had me convinced there was nothing better than a pint of 'Shippos' in front of the wood Cup television at the Stanhope Arms.
