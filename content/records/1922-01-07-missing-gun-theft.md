**A MISSING GUN.**

**MAN CHARGED WITH THEFT AT DALE ABBEY.**

Frederick Coombes, a smart-looking, powerfully-built young man was remanded at Ilkeston on Thursday charged with stealing a gun, value £12, belonging to Robert Sisson, a farmer, of Dale Abbey.

Sisson said that he and his son Alec were rabbit shooting on his farm on Wednesday afternoon when a neighbouring farmer named Wheatley, his son, and the defendant entered the field. Witness had some conversation with Wheatley, during which the defendant stood a few yards away. When the conversation was finished the defendant had disappeared, and witness did not see him again. When he came to pack up his things he missed the gun, and a long search for it proved fruitless.

Police-constable Parfitt was informed, and Coombes was caught. He tried to escape, but the constable chased him, and eventually secured him again.

Coombes said that he had no fixed address, and no friends—they were all enemies. He hailed from near Edinburgh, and worked at Stanton up to three weeks ago, when a number of them were discharged. His last place of abode was 14, Willoughby Street, Lenton, Nottingham—a lodging-house.
