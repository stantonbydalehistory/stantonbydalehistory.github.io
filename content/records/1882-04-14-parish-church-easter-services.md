**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

**PARISH CHURCH.**—The services at the parish church of Stanton-by-Dale on Sunday were most appropriate for the season. The sacred edifice was beautifully decorated with plants and flowers from the conservatory of Mr. C. B. Palmer, of Stanton Hall, and a profusion of primroses, in the arrangement of which great labour and pains had been bestowed. The effect of the ornamentation was heightened rather than otherwise by the beautiful lamps of Etruscan design recently introduced into the church. The congregation on Sunday evening was numerous. The prayers were read by the Rector, the Rev. W. Fox, the lessons being read by the Rev. — Trewman curate. The preacher was the Rev. J. H. Godber, of Nottingham. Mr C. B. Palmer conducted the musical portion of the services, and Mr. A. Barber efficiently presided at the organ.
