Although Glover describes St. Alkmund's Workhouse as having in 1832 been very much out of repair, it is worthy of note that in 1797 Sir F. M. Eden writing on "The State of the Poor in England," pays a very high compliment to this institution, which he describes as "the best poor-house in Derby, as it was airy, very clean, and well provided with good feather beds." As to the origin of these workhouses, Dr. Cox tells us that there was nothing in Derbyshire that would correspond to such an institution earlier than the 18th century, unless it might have been in the Boroughs of Derby or Chesterfield. The first instance, he reminds us, of the common action of various parishes and townships in providing a workhouse, occurred in the year 1738, when the Church-wardens and overseers of Dale Abbey, Stanton-by-Dale, Sandiacre, Risley, Wilne, Breaston, Draycott, Wilne Mills, Ilkeston, Little Hallam, Stanley, and Mapperly united to built "a certain cottage workhouse or place for the habitation and employing the poor of and belonging to the said several parishes and townes upon a certain common or moor, called Dale or Stanton Moor." This document is preserved amongst the Derbyshire County Records, because in such a case it was necessary to obtain the consent of the Lords of the Manor wherein the building was situate. This formal consent is signed and sealed by the Hon. Harry, Lord Grey, and John Stanhope, Esq., who were lords of the manors of Dale and Stanton. There are also preserved some curious rules enforced at the Winster House of Industry, established in 1744.


Note: Likely referring to Dr J Cox, historian of Derbyshire who also compiled "The Parish Registers of England" though note that this doesn't mention Stanton or Dale Abbey.
