**STANTON.**

**OBITUARY.**

The death of Mr. George Hall, Dale-road, Stanton, on Thursday last week, is deeply mourned by his many friends. A native of Buckinghamshire, Mr. Hall came to this locality in his youth, and for upwards of 40 years was employed at Stanton Ironworks. He was a man of sterling character, had a courteous, genial and kindly disposition, and won the respect of all who came to be associated with him, whether at his place of employment or in connection with the Stanton Institute, of which he acted as caretaker for some ten years. The late Mr. Hall was a member of the Stanhope Lodge of Oddfellows. He attended the Wesleyan Chapel. Gardening was a hobby in which he took particular interest, and in past years he had taken a part, as committee member, in organising the local flower show.

The late Mr. Hall, who was 62 years of age, had been ill for some months, the distressing malady from which he suffered proving, in spite of all that could be done by medical skill, to be incurable. He leaves a widow and two daughters, for whom much sympathy is felt. The funeral took place on Saturday afternoon at the Stanton Parish Church, the Rev. C. Leeper, curate at Holy Trinity Church, Ilkeston, officiating.

The mourners were Mrs. Hall (widow), Mr. E. Harrop (son-in-law), Mr. and Mrs. Mellor (son-in-law and daughter), Mrs. Dickens, Mrs. Cox, Mrs. Tofield, Mrs. Hall (sisters), Mr. and Mrs. T. Carter (brother-in-law and sister-in-law), Mrs. Saville (niece), Mrs. Hall (sister-in-law), Mr. and Mrs. L. Barber, Mr. T. Northwood, Mr. A. J. Whitlock and Mr. W. Shimwell. The following acted as bearers: Messrs. S. Barber, W. Waller, T. Bower, H. Fawcett, R. Sisson and W. Cartwright. The Stanhope Lodge of Oddfellows was represented.

Floral tributes were from the following:—Wife, Nellie and Ralph; Ernest, Alice and Children; His Four Sisters; Mrs. M. Hall; Mr. and Mrs. Carter; Bertha and Arthur; Ted, Annie and Effie; Mr. and Mrs. Porter, Florrie and Will; Mr. and Mrs. Tornley; Mr. and Mrs. Haywood; Mr. and Mrs. Frith; Mrs. and Will; Mr. and Mrs. Thornley; Mr. and Mrs. L. Barber; Mr. and Mrs. Winfield; Mr. and Mrs. Matchett; Fellow Workmen at the Pattern Shop; the Stanton Institute; Girls at Dale. Mr. F. Scattergood carried out the funeral arrangements.—Mrs. Hall and family desire to thank all friends for kind sympathy shown to them in their bereavement.
