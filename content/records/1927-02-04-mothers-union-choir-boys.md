**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

**Mothers' Union.**—The annual Mothers' Union tea and social was held in the Clubroom, Stanton, on January 25th, when a large number of members were present. Through the kindness of Mrs. Crompton, Stanton Hall, the members were entertained to a splendid ham tea. Mrs. Vardy, the president, addressed the guests, also Mrs. Sanderson. Miss Foster contributed songs, Mrs. Wall two sketches and a friend of Mrs. Wall two events. Dancing and games were much enjoyed and the evening passed away most pleasantly. The Rev. Finlay Sanderson, the new rector, who was heartily welcomed, proposed a warm vote to their kind hostess, for so kindly providing such a bountiful tea.

**Choir Boys' Supper.**—The annual treat for the junior members of St. Michael and All Angels' Choir was held in the club-room, Stanton, on Jan. 26th. A splendid tea was provided, to which the youngsters did full justice. Games and fun, with music followed tea. Book prizes were presented by Mrs. Sanderson, and money prizes, for regular attendance at services and practices, were kindly presented by Mr. C. R. Crompton, churchwarden, who generously supplemented this prize money with the gift to each individual member of the junior choir with a special gift of a pound Treasury note to Arthur Nettleship and William Sisson, who are leaving the junior section of the choir on account of their age. A hearty vote of thanks was accorded to Mrs. Sanderson and Mr. Crompton for presenting the prizes, and on the proposition of Kevin King, seconded by Charlie Mills, a vote of thanks was given to the ladies, for so kindly preparing the tea. The new rector, the Rev. Finlay Sanderson, was also present, with Mrs. S. P. Cox, Mrs. Coe, Mrs. Nissen, Mrs. Lye, and Mrs. Bower. The arrangements were in the capable hands of Mr. S. P. Cox, organist and choirmaster.
