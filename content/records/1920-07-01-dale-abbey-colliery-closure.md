**CLOSED DOWN.**

**DALE ABBEY COLLIERY'S CAREER AT AN END.**

Dale Abbey Colliery, half-way between Ilkeston and Derby, has just closed down. Owned by the Stanton Ironworks Company, Ltd., it is what is known as a "foot-rill" pit, the miners walking into it from the surface. The colliery has been working for close upon half a century, getting the Kilburn seam at a thickness of 5ft. 3in. Until of late there has been on an average an output of about 150 tons per day. Prior to the war 120 men were employed, but during the last four or five years the number fell to about ninety, and these continued in employment there up to the time the pit closed down.

The seam gradually dipped from the surface, and was worked to a length of 1,200 yards, all the coal having been obtained between the boundaries of two faults. Boring has been in progress to ascertain the lower seams. The Naughton was found to be 2ft. 10in. thick, and the Alton 2ft. 3in. thick, which were, of course, not thick enough to be worked profitably. The Belper Lawn seam was not reached.
