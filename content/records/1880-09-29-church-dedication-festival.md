**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

**CHURCH DEDICATION FESTIVAL.**—On Sunday, the 26th Sept., special services in honour of the dedication of the church of St. Michael and All Angels were held in this village. The church was tastefully decorated for the occasion by the Misses Fox, C. B. Palmer, Esq., and other devoted church workers in the parish. The motto over the communion table was "We praise Thee, O God," in large white letters on a dark ground. In addition to the vases of flowers on the table, were two massive brass candlesticks and an elegant cross, also of brass, the gift of C. B. Palmer Esq. The altar cloth had a white wreath, with gold fringe, and a costly lace super-frontal. In the centre was a crimson cross, in a circle. Within the precincts of the altar rails was a choice variety of beautiful exotic flowers and plants. At the entrance to the chancel a temporary screen of evergreens had been erected, on the apex of which was a cross of white lilies. The pulpit and lectern were prettily adorned with flowers and evergreens. The font, however, deserves special mention, as its decoration was exceedingly effective. In the centre was a large cross of pure white lilies, supported on four standards. The capitals of the pillars of the church were also neatly wreathed with flowers and evergreens. The morning service commenced with a processional hymn (21, Ancient and Modern) and the *Te Deum* was sung to a chant service arranged by A. L. Cooper. After hymn 423, Ancient and Modern, there was a sermon by the rector, the Rev. W. Fox, and choral celebration of Holy Communion at 11.46, the service being sung to Dyke in F; after which hymn 203, Church Hymns, and 255, Ancient and Modern, were sung. The evening service commenced at 6.30 with 431, Church Hymns, as a processional. The *Magnificat* and *Nunc Dimittis* were sung to Parisian Tones, arranged by Stainer. The anthem, which was very effectively rendered, was by Spohr, "As pants the hart." After the singing of hymn 395, Ancient and Modern, the Rev. J. H. Ordber preached the sermon. The service concluded with a recessional 480, Church Hymns. The offertories throughout the day amounted to upwards of 7l., and will be devoted to the school funds.—On Monday, the 27th, there was a public tea party in the Club-room, the trays being presided over by the ladies of the congregation. About 150 persons partook of an excellent tea. At seven o'clock a literary and musical entertainment was held. The opening piece was a part song, "The Poppies," which was sung by the choir. Mr. Gainsby then gave a sailor's song, "Polly," with good effect. The Rev. A. E. Evans read "The Dream of Eugene Aram," which was much received. "The Yeoman's Wedding," sung by Mr. Palmer, with taste and precision, elicited an *encore*. Mr. Palmer then sang "Three Jolly Sailor boys," which was received with applause. The children's song, "Glad the blast may blow," was rendered with spirit. The Rev. W. Fox then read "The defence of a Roman Bridge." This was followed by a part song, "Now is the month of Maying," by Messrs. Palmer, J. Sisson, A. Barber (Repton), and L. Sisson, which was highly appreciated. In the song "Sir Garnet will show them the way," Mr. D. Scattergood was applauded. Mr. Thomas Riley, however, received rapturous applause in his song "Some folks say." This concluded the first part of the programme. The second part opened with a part song "Hark! the Lark" by the choir; and was followed by a pianoforte duet, "Cambria," by Miss K. Scattergood; a song by Mr. Palmer; the "Song of the Brotherhood" and "Night is falling," by the children; the "Speech of Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz" by Mr. Pallen; the song, "Kit the Cobbler," by Mr. Gainsby; the trio, "Diane Durden," by Messrs. J. Sisson, D. Scattergood, and L. Sisson; the song, "Perverted Proverbs," by Mr. A.H. Barber, and concluded with the National Anthem. There was a large attendance, and all the pieces were creditably rendered.
