**PETTY SESSIONS, Monday,—**(Before Sir J. G. N. Alleyne and Mr. W. C. Haslam.)

**REMANDED CASE OF FELONY.—**Samuel Wormington and Thomas Barton were charged with stealing a horse collar and harness, the property of William Newton, at Stanton-by-Dale, on the 9th of July last.—Complainant said he was a contractor, and resided at Dale Abbey. He had a shed at Stanton-by-Dale in which he kept harness, and had dealings with the Stanton Iron Company. He worked at a saw pit, and on the day named at 2.30 he noticed both prisoners loitering about. The next morning he found the shed had been broken open and the collar and harness missing.—Wm. Tonks, a boatman, said he was in the Boat Inn, Sandiacre on the 10th of July. Barton offered to sell him a collar and harness for 5s. and a pint of beer. He did so, and Barton afterwards went away. The collar and harness were then placed in the hands of Police-constable Whitaker. This officer deposed that he apprehended the first-named defendant at Sandiacre on the 9th of August. He charged him with the offence, which defendant denied.—Inspector Conley, of Ilkeston, said he apprehended Barton at Cromford on the 11th of August, and charged him with the offence. He also denied it, saying he did not even known where Stanton-by-Dale was.—The Bench said there was not sufficient evidence to commit Wormington, and he was discharged. He was immediately taken into custody by the Notts. police for some robberies committed by him in their district.—Barton was committed for trial at the Sessions.
