**ILKESTON POLICE COURT**

**Wednesday.—(Before Mr. J. Ball.)**

A Special Court was held this morning at the Town Hall.

**Drunkenness.**—Albert Davis, a vagrant, was charged with drunkenness.—Police-Constable Davis deposed to finding the prisoner about 1.15 a.m. on Wednesday morning in Pimlico asleep and in a state of drunkenness lying across some rails.—Defendant pleaded guilty, and was fined 2s. 6d. and costs (10s. in all), or seven days.

**Alleged Rape.**—George Valentine, employed at the Stanton Ironworks, was charged with violently assaulting and ravishingly Clara Barber at Stanton-by-Dale on October 15th. Complainant, a young woman of prepossessing appearance, said on the day in question she was going to Stapleford from Stanton Dale, when she met defendant on the road near a stone stile. He asked the way to Stanton, and she told him, and as soon as she had done so he took hold of her, flung her down, and committed the offence complained of. She did not know the man at all. She resisted, shouted, and struggled, but he held his hand over her mouth. A little girl came on the scene, and prosecutor told her to go for Mr. Barber. Prisoner then made off the same road he had come. She went with Police-Constable Crook last night, and identified him at the Stanton Ironworks.—Police-Constable Crook testified to going with the prosecutrix to the Stanton Ironworks, and said she at once picked out the prisoner.—By Mr. Ball: To whom did you complain at first?—Prosecutrix: To a little girl who appeared on the scene.—How long was that after the offence? Only a few minutes.—Prisoner, who had nothing to say for himself, was remanded for a space not exceeding eight days, in the meantime he would go to Derby.
