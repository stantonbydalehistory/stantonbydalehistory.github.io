**EX-SOLDIER IN TROUBLE.**

William Smith, an ex-soldier and a labourer at the Stanton Ironworks, pleaded guilty to being disorderly and refusing to quit the Stanhope Arms, Stanton-by-Dale, on May 16th, also to assaulting the landlord, Dick Richard Scattergood.

Mr. F. G. Robinson prosecuted, and it was stated that the defendant picked up a glass and struck the landlord a severe blow on the eye, which dazed him, and caused blood to flow freely.

Fines and costs in each case amounting to £2 19s. 6d. were imposed, in default 21 days' imprisonment.
