**STANTON-BY-DALE IRON WORKS.—**A correspondent says that owing to the depressed state of trade, these works have been over-run by hands seeking employment, and that the opportunity has been taken to reduce the wages of men 4d., and of boys 2d per day. Great discontent and a general turn-out ensued, but owing to the scarcity of work everywhere at this season, most of the hands have been compelled to resume work at the reduced wages.
