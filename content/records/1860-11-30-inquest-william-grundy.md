**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

**INQUEST.—**On Wednesday the 14th inst., an inquest was held at the Stanhope Arms Inn, by Mr. Whiston, coroner, on the body of William Grundy, an old man aged 80. The following evidence was elicited :—Deceased left his house in the afternoon of the previous Monday to fetch the cows from the field, when not returning, search was made, and he was found dead in the field. It appears that he had lost his wife during the previous week, which had preyed very much on his mind. He had been subject to fits and had been medically attended by Mr. Bland, surgeon, of Sandiacre. The Jury returned a verdict of "Found dead in a field from disease of the heart."
