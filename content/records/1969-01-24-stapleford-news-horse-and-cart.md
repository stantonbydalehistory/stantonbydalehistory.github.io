**WHERE YOU CAN ALMOST EXPECT TO FIND A HORSE AND CART!**

Fifty years is a long time. For some, it is a life-time. But there is no doubt that a place can change tremendously in that time.

Take Stanton-by-Dale, for example. Fifty or so years ago was not far removed from the turn of the century.

A big change is in fact noticeable on national trends. Expansion has not yet reached Stanton-by-Dale, about 600 people now live there and about 300 lived in Stanton-by-Dale fifty years ago. Although the figures are somewhere in the region of 331 per cent increase.

And not just what was like 50 years ago. So places change, not just in the house building but in the school side of this. New residents. Mr. and Mrs. W. Michael are all residents who remember what was here 50 years ago. Nothing, not much has changed.

**Not Altered Much**

“Some items of comment when saying village has changed in that time. But things are still of the same.” In the centre of activity is the church, Village Hall and the Cricket Club.

The village was 50 years ago much the same which is of course of all that older village folk insist. The bowling green, the Village Hall, the church school and the church, Village Hall and the Cricket Club, and the shop we’re of little, although more lodge is around of the building the lodge is just around the church end.

Last night Tuesday the men of the village would march to the church service. According to account of Mr. Dela Bond.

The Cricket Club was of course important and had probably just held its 50th anniversary at that time.

**Village Square**

Similarly attractive to the Village of Stanton-by-Dale the cricket was of course around which is what the main hall was around.

The lifting of the bell occasion, Mr. G. F. Morrel, who was a village policeman, the big event, who kept the Cricket Club pitch, which they still sit thinking of.

In the holiday those days, in Stanton-by-Dale in those days had something of about 100 pupils. Those days had something in the region of 100 pupils.

To-day the same school takes about 40 children from the village.

Because of the village’s close connection with Stanton Ironworks, 50 years ago, nearly all who lived in Stanton-by-Dale and worked there. There were just a few who were employed in local farms.

**Tradition**

To-day an important part of Stanton-by-Dale’s community life is the women’s Institute. Mr. Bond says the centre was the village hall which is the centre of village life.

In the evening, the men would go to Tradition, the Wakes. Not so of course now. In those times, occupied by Rev. G. F. Morrel, his family for a member was looking after the lodge, and it is of these building which add doing something the village did.

Although church bells sound in the traditional and the school house which in a road and a place. The green, where people in dog and their children would bath, was in cycling for Beacon, on the croves and similar items.

The Village which is an important part of the life of Rev. the Rector was of attendance to the church each Sunday was about 30.

**Since About**

Chapel in the village, which had also attracted a fair share of the population in Stanton-by-Dale.

A wide attendance of the village was looked after by the Parish Council as it is to-day.

Looking back over the 50 years, one thing which Mr. Morrel regrets has gone from the village scene, is the village policeman, who was one of the central figures in the village; probably as important as the village cross, which even to-day seems to stand as a sentinel watching over village life.

Although the village’s two pubs—The Chequers and the Stanhope Arms still remain, another important building has gone. The smithy. This was situated on Stanhope-street.

To-day Stanton-by-Dale has a problem with heavy traffic using the village as a through-road. But 50 years ago there was a much different situation, for there were only about three cars in the whole village. The average man’s journey was undertaken either on foot or on bicycle.

For longer excursions to Nottingham or further afield, the common route was to walk to Stanton Gate Station, from where the journey was completed by train.

“Many people from the village walked to Ilkeston every week to do their shopping. Bread was delivered to the village and everyday needs could be obtained at the general store, which was the N.A. branch of the Stapleford and Sandiacre Co-operative Society. There was also a sweet shop in the village.

Comparing the village now, Mr. Morrel and Mrs. Morrel say both agree that there has been very little change in Stanton-by-Dale. The village has been affected by progress, but it is one of the few places around here where, as one walks along the village streets, one can almost EXPECT to see a horse and cart coming in the other direction.
