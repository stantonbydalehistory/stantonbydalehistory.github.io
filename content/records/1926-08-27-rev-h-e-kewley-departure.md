**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

**The Rev. H. E. Kewley.**—It is with great regret that we have to announce that the Rev. H. E. Kewley, rector of Stanton-by-Dale Parish Church and chaplain of Dale Abbey Church since Nov. 15th, 1905, is about to leave the combined parishes. The rector has accepted the living of Askham, in Nottinghamshire, offered by the Lord Bishop of the Diocese, and is leaving for reasons of health. All our readers will regret to learn that the Rev. Kewley has nobly fulfilled his duties at Stanton and Dale Abbey in spite of continued failing health. In announcing his early departure to his parishioners, the rector stated that he would be sorely grieved to part from after working together for so many years, and sharing their warm-hearted sympathy. He had been keenly conscious for some time past that he was no longer strong enough to do the work of such a large and exacting parish. The Rev. W. E. Kewley has had an interesting and highly successful career. He was formerly curate at St. Peter's Church, Derby, the largest and poorest parish of that town, where his work is still remembered with affection and gratitude. He was also connected with Sudbury Parish Church, where again his genial personality and charm together with his hard work, counted much towards his success. The Rev. H. E. Kewley has always had the credit for acting upon principle rather than upon expediency: for doing a thing or leaving it undone, according as it was right or wrong, and not according as it was popular or not. He always valued "a good conscience" far more than a good name. The rector will leave Stanton and Dale Abbey with the best wishes of everybody. We can only add that what is Stanton and Dale Abbey's loss is Askham's gain.
