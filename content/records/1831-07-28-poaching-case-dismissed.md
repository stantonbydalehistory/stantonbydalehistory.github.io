Samuel Bacon, waggoner to Mr. Hollingworth, of Dale Abbey, was summoned on Friday last before the magistrates assembled in Petty Sessions at the County Hall, to answer a charge of poaching at Dale Abbey. It appeared that Joseph Cooke, gamekeeper to Mr. Hall, of Stanton, had found a hare in a snare in the hedge, by the road side leading to Mr. Morrell's farm, which he watched for two days and a night, in the expectation of securing the poacher; but at last somebody took the hare during his temporary absence to obtain refreshment. Cooke afterwards put another hare into the snare which Bacon saw and turned over, but did not take it away, when the watchers pounced upon him and charged him with poaching. The magistrates dismissed the case.
