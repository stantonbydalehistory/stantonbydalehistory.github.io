**OVERALLS STOLEN**

**LONG EATON MAN PLACED ON PROBATION**

Robert Charles Streets (19), a stenciller, of Derby-road, Long Eaton, accused of stealing a pair of overalls, valued at 5s. 9d., the property of George Albert Mee, of Tolls-avenue, Long Eaton, between August 20 and 21, was, at Ilkeston Police Court to-day, placed on probation for two years and ordered to pay 20s. 2d. costs.

Mee stated that he left the overalls in a box at Stanton Ironworks, and found them missing next day.

Police-constable Vickers said he recovered from Streets a pair of overalls which were identified by Mee as his. Streets at first said the overalls were his own property, but later admitted they were not.

Streets, who had two previous convictions for theft, told the magistrates that he had recently started on a new job and promised to behave himself in future.

Norman Smales, railway fireman, Springfield-avenue, Sandiacre, was fined 7s. 6d. for cycling without a front light at Sandiacre on August 21.
