**'Peeping' youths bound over**

When Mr. Gordon Spendlove, of 7 Cloudside Road, Sandiacre, came home late one night he saw two youths peering in through a window, it was stated at Ilkeston yesterday.

Thomas James Laurie (19), blacksmith, of 42 Dale Road, Stanton-by-Dale, and David Dawson (17), junior operative, of 6 Dale Road, Stanton-by-Dale, were bound over for 12 months for acting in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by peeping at Sandiacre.

Laurie was also fined £1 10s. for using indecent language. They pleaded "Not guilty."
