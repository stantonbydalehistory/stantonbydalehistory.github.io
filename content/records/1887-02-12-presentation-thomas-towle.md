**PRESENTATION.**

Last Saturday evening, the members of the Wesleyan society and congregation at Stanton assembled in the village club-room for the purpose of publicly and practically recognising the services of Mr. Thomas Towle, of Stapleford, who, during the last quarter of a century, has served them in the capacity of musical-trainer in connection with their special services, concerts, etc. The proceedings opened with a social tea, to which the Rev. Wm. Russell, circuit minister, and a number of gentlemen who have, from time to time, rendered the society musical aid were invited. Afterwards, Mr. Eben Barber, the oldest male member present, was voted to the chair, and made some affecting allusions to the changes made by death during the last thirty years in the Stanton Wesleyan society. The Rev. W. Russell, in presenting Mr. Towle, on behalf of the congregation, with a handsome marble time-piece, made some lively reference to his connection with Stanton. Mr. Towle was personally unknown to him, but twenty-five years of generous aid to the church in reducing debts, purchasing harmonium, and training choir, was enough to assure his worth. He hoped that Mr. Towle, as he heard the time-piece tell the half-hours and the hours, would be reminded of the happy past, as well as of the friends still remaining at Stanton. Mr. Towle, in responding, thanked the minister for his kindly words and the assembled friends for their generous acknowledgment of his services. In taking a retrospective survey of the last twenty-eight years, he had been able to assemble before his mental vision quite an array of events in an astonishingly vivid manner. In making weekly visits to an aged church member named Thomas Mee, who was rapidly declining, he had become acquainted with the late William Morrall, Henry Lee, and others, and was pressed by them to begin a singing-class. Forty-eight members attended, and considerable success resulted from his efforts. Many of those present would remember the concerts that had been given by the Stanton choir, and in combination with choirs from Stapleford, Basford, Ilkeston, and Nottingham. He should be as willing to render assistance in the future as he had been in the past, and their beautiful present would be esteemed as one of his dearest earthly treasures. Several others spoke, and three or four vocal and instrumental pieces were rendered by the musical friends present. The audience joined in singing "Onward, Christian soldiers," and spent the rest of the evening in creative amusements.
