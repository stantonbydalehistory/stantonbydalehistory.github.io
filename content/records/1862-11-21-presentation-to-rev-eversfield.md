**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

**PRESENTATION TO A CLERGYMAN.**—A numerous gathering of the inhabitants of the above place, took place last Friday evening, to testify their esteem and mark of respect to the Rev. Stephen Eversfield, who a about leaving the village, after a sojourn of 7½ years of pastoral duty. A number of friends and others assembled in the new school-room, when the rev. gentleman was invited to attend, and upon his introduction was received with hearty cheers. Mr. Barber, who kindly presided on the occasion, in addressing Mr. Eversfield, said:—Sir, we are assembled this evening in order to pay you a tribute of respect for the very efficient manner in which you have performed your duties during your residence here, and I could have wished some one who has been a longer resident than myself would have undertaken this pleasing duty. And, dear sir, in presenting you with this testimonial, I am sure I am expressing the heart-felt wishes of the inhabitants generally that you may live long to enjoy it, and that every blessing may attend you in your new pastorate. (Applause.) Silence having been restored, the rev. gentleman, with much emotion, spoke as follows:—My dear christian friends, I cannot express my feelings on the present occasion. When I came into this room for the purpose of distributing the tickets to the members of the clothing society, I was perfectly unacquainted with your kind intetion of presenting me with this handsome testimonial. I value it not only on account of its intrinsic worth, but more especially for the kind feeling which has been shewn to me by the parishioners of Stanton. I may say I have always been received by you with the greatest kindness, and more particularly when attending you in my ministerial capacity. You have invariably welcomed me to your homes when I have visited you for the purpose of reading God's Holy Word and for prayer. I do hope that if we do not meet again in this world we may, both old and young, meet at the judgement seat of Christ, and be welcomed as good and faithful servants of our Lord and Saviour.—The address of the rev. gentleman was listened to with great attention. The testimonial consisted of a beautiful silver salver, elegantly chased, supplied by Mr. Sheppard, Long-row, Nottingham, and engraved in a superior manner, bearing the following inscription:—" Presented to the Rev. Stephen Eversfield, by the inhabitants of Stanton-by-Dale, Derbyshire, in grateful remembrance of his labours amongst them during the space of 7½ years. November 15, 1862."—Immediately afterwards a very neat and useful work box was presented to Miss Eversfield, by the scholars in her class, as a mark of respect for her kindness and great attention to them all, which was suitably acknowledged on her behalf by her brother (Mr. Eversfield.)—On the Saturday evening, in accordance with the wishes of many of the congregation, an elegant paper machie envelope case, accompanied with a writing case of the same material, beautifully inlaid with pearl, and a silver mounted ivory handle pen holder, was presented to Miss Eversfield, in consideration of the very efficient services rendered by her in playing the harmonium, gratuitously, at the church, for a period of 7½ years, and often at personal inconvenience; also, in very materially assisting the choir. Miss Eversfield was much affected at this unexpected compliment, when was much admired, and a suitable acknowledgment having been made, the proceedings, which was of a very interesting character, terminated with singing the Doxology.—We understand that the rev. gentleman is appointed one of the curates at St. Paul's, Burslem, Staffordshire, and we are sure both he and his sister will take with them the hearty good wishes of the inhabitants generally.
