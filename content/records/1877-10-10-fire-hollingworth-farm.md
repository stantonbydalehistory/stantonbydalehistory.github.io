**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

On Saturday morning, the 6th October, a fire broke out upon the farm premises of Mr. Hollingworth, of the Grove Farm, Stanton. The family had retired to rest at an usual hour, and about one o'clock in the morning Mr. Hollingworth awoke, and perceived a smell as of a candle smouldering. He naturally thought his servant had left a candle burning, and on getting up to ascertain if such was the case, he immediately saw a blaze proceeding from his stackyard, in which there are eight or nine large stacks. He at once aroused the inmates of his house, and despatched messengers to Ilkeston and Derby for the fire engines. It appeared that a haystack of between 40 and 50 tons was on fire. Every effort was used to prevent the flames from spreading to the neighbouring stacks. The Ilkeston Fire Brigade were soon on the spot, but the flames were got under before they arrived. In about 10 minutes afterwards the Derby fire arrived, and the members of both brigades worked away to entirely subdue the smouldering fire with praiseworthy energy. It appeared that for several weeks the stack had presented signs of being overheated, in consequence of the crop being gathered before it was thoroughly dry, and that openings had been cut into it in several places to let out the heat, but these steps proved ineffectual. Refreshments were supplied to the firemen, and the Derby brigade left about five o'clock, and the Ilkeston brigade at seven o'clock. We understand that this is the first fire at which the Ilkeston firemen have been present, and that great credit is due to them for the promptness with which they arrived on the spot. Fortunately, the damage sustained by Mr. Hollingworth will not amount to a large sum.
