**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

**A VISITATION FROM GOD.—**Mr. W. H. Whiston held an inquiry at the Stanhope Arms, Stanton-by-Dale, on Friday afternoon, into the circumstances attending the death of James Dexter, aged 64, farmer, of Dale Abbey, which occurred suddenly on Wednesday morning. The body was identified by Elizabeth Dexter, the widow, who stated that the deceased went to Derby on Tuesday, and when he came back he was wet through. He slept with a man named Draper that night, and early the next morning she was called up to him. He was in bed and alive, but she could plainly see that he was dying. She ran to fetch him some whiskey, but he was dead by the time she came back again.—The next witness was Frank Draper, who lives in Cranmer-street, Ilkeston, who said he had known the deceased some years. He called at witness's house on Tuesday morning, and witness told him that he should like to ride with him to Derby. Deceased said he had some business to do in Derby, and they went together. It rained very hard all the way back, and on reaching deceased's house at about seven o'clock on Tuesday deceased persuaded him to stay the night. He consented, and they both went to bed together. Deceased then seemed in capital health. Next morning he awoke, and after talking together for some time witness noticed that the deceased seemed struggling with his breath. He told witness he had slept well all night. Witness called Mrs. Dexter, who came, but deceased died directly after.—The jury returned a verdict to the effect that the deceased died suddenly by a visitation from God from natural causes.
