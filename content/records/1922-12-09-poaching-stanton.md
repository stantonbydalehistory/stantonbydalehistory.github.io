**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

**SMARTLY CAUGHT.**

At Ilkeston Petty Sessions, on Thursday, Thos. Baker, 17, King George-street, Nottingham was charged with an offence under the Poaching Prevention Act at Stanton-by-Dale, on November 28th.—Sergeant Bramley said he was cycling on Quarry Hill, when he saw defendant leave a field belonging to Mrs. Pegg. His coat pocket was bulky, and upon being searched it was found to contain 13 pegs, two wet nets and one bag. His boots were wet. Defendant first gave a wrong address.—P.c. Parfitt corroborated.—A fine of 50 shillings was imposed and the nets and bag were confiscated.
