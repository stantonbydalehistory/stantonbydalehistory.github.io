**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

**ST. MICHAEL'S CHURCH.**—This church has been renovated at a cost of £1,300. Re-opening services were held on Thursday, September 25th. The Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Lichfield delivered a most impressive and earnest address on the importance of union with Christ, and growth in grace. His lordship dwelt specially on church attendance, the Sacraments of the Church, and the three-fold agency by which she was sustained and governed, i.e., bishops, priests, and deaconry. He spoke of the great importance and responsibility of the ministerial office and the duty of the congregation to pray for their pastor. There were fourteen local clergy present. The service for the re-opening of the church was first gone through; then followed the institution of the rector, the Rev. W. Fox, B.A. The Bishop having read the letters of institution, laid his hand on the head of the new incumbent, pronouncing a suitable benediction. This part of the day's ceremony performed, the next in order was the consecration of an additional piece of churchyard. The bishop and clergy walked round the ground in procession, repeating alternately the 49th Psalm. The Sentence of Consecration was read and signed by the Bishop. An appropriate hymn was then sung, and the proceedings terminated. The attendance at the morning service was very large. A sermon was preached in the afternoon by the late rector, the Rev. J. Freshfield, M.A., of London. The collections during the day amounted to £52 10s. The bells rang merry peals during the day, and the flag hoisted on the steeple. Luncheon was provided in the schoolroom between the services. The church was very beautifully decorated. The days' services were of a very impressive character. The living of Stanton is in the gift of the Earl of Stanhope.
