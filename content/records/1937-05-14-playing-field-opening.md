**FIRM'S GIFT TO VILLAGE OF STANTON**

**NEW PLAYING FIELD OPENED**

The new Stanton-by-Dale playing field, which has been given by the Stanton Ironworks Co., Ltd., and equipped by the Stanton Parish Council, was opened by Mr. E. J. Fox, managing director of the Stanton Ironworks Co., Ltd.

Mr. Fox referred to many of the old sporting stalwarts of Stanton-by-Dale and asked the children to live up to the example of their elders. He paid a tribute to the Parish Council and Coronation Committee.

Children's sports were held on the playing field, and these were followed by tea in the schoolroom, when all the children were presented with mugs, medals, and pencils.

The medals had been given by Mr. C. R. Crompton, of The Hall, Stanton-by-Dale and the pencils by Mr. W. Adams.

A tea was given to the aged people of the village, but the adults' sports arranged for the evening had to be postponed, and the fancy dress parade was held in the schoolroom.

A service in the Parish Church was conducted by the Rev. A. B. Roberts.
