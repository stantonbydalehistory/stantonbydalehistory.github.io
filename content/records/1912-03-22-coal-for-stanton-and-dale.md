**COAL FOR STANTON AND DALE.**

Earl Stanhope has given permission to all his cottage tenants in Stanton and Dale to mine coal in the old open pit on Grove Farm. The seam, which is of superior quality, varies from two to three feet in thickness, and on Saturday mining operations were in full swing with all the equipment of drills, pulley blocks, shots, etc. Several tons were mined and carried away by scores of the cottagers, and by the kindness of the earl these two villages are assured of fuel as long as the strike may last. A surprising amount of coal and slack was found by the hundreds who, on Saturday, by permission of the Stanton Ironworks Company, picked over the banks of slag and refuse around the works.
