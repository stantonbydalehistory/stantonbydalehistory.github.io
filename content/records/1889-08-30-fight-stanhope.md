**ILKESTON.**  
**PETTY SESSIONS, Thursday.**—Before the Mayor (Ald. Wade), Ald. F. Sudbury, and Mr. N. S. Adlington.

**A PUBLIC-HOUSE ROW.**—Simon Ridgeway, of Stapleford, was charged with being drunk and disorderly on the licensed premises of Mr. Scattergood, who keeps the Stanhope Arms at Stanton-by-Dale, on Saturday last. He admitted the charge. There was a further charge against him of having committed an assault upon Mr. Scattergood at the same time and place.

The complainant stated that on the day in question the defendant came to his house, and after he had been there for some time the servant girl complained that he was using bad language. Witness requested him to leave, but he refused, and in the course of the discussion struck witness, and knocked him down. Witness put him out of the house after some trouble, and was again assaulted, this time receiving a black eye. The defendant again made his way into the house, and was again forcibly put out.—The defendant alleged that a disturbance arose through a man with whom he made a wager refusing to pay when he lost. He was not aware that the complainant was assaulted during the disturbance, however.—A fine of 10s. and costs was imposed in each case—£2 5s. 6d. altogether.
