**STANTON-BY-DALE.**

The forthcoming induction of the vicar recalls the fact that the Rev W. Fox has ministered here 31 years. It is one of the oldest churches in the country, and was rebuilt more than 600 years ago. A year before the late Vicar took up his residence there the church was restored at a cost of £1,600. The register dates back just 300 years, and it may be added that the Rectory carries with it the private chaplaincy to Earl Stanhope, the patron.
