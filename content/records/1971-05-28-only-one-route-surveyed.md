AVAILABLE evidence so far indicates that only one route has been surveyed for the M42 Nottingham — Birmingham motorway, said South-East Derbyshire MP Mr. Peter Rost this week.

And that is the route which skirts Risley and crosses the Erewash Valley Golf Club course.

Said Mr. Rost: "I want it firmly established that more than one route will be properly surveyed so that there is no doubt that every alternative has been investigated before a final choice is recommended by the Minister."

Following evidence collected by the Stanton-by-Dale and Risley Action Group of the Midland Road Construction Unit's survey, Mr. Rost has tabled a question for answer in the House of Commons on Wednesday, June 9.

**OTHER ROUTES?**

He is asking whether the Unit has taken or is talking or will be taking boreholes along alternative projected routes in addition to the boreholes now being prepared just north of Risley.

Reporting to Thursday's annual meeting of Stanton-by-Dale Parish Council about the Action Group's activities, the clerk, Mr. F. G. Wheeler—who is also the Action Group's secretary—said that they had been advised that the cost of producing an alternative survey of the route would be £20,000 to £30,000.

This was completely out of the question financially.

The chairman, Coun. the Rev. C. J. W. Lee, who was appointed the Parish Council's representative on a new Action Group committee, said:

**'AGGRAVATING'**

"The aggravating point is that all the information we have to get is already obtainable and the Ministry have got it. But we would still have to produce it afresh."

The next meeting of the committee — in about a month's time — will be addressed by a speaker from the Midland Road Construction Unit, it was reported.

The news brought this comment from Coun. Mrs. J. D. Hickman: "What is he going to talk to us about? He is not going to tell us anything."

Agreed the clerk: "I cannot see that he will give us a great deal of information."

So far the Unit has said that they are surveying the Risley and Stanton route—but that no decision on a firm route has yet been taken.

The line is expected to be officially revealed towards the end of this year.
