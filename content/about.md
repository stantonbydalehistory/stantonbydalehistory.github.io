# About This Site

I moved to Stanton-by-Dale with my wife in 2021 and have always been interested in genealogy. After exhausting my own family tree on both sides, I decided to try researching the history of our house.

In doing so, I discovered tons of fascinating minutiae (and plenty of dull mundane stuff... which is much lower priority for adding here!) in old census records and newspaper articles — snippets of village life, court cases, accidents, celebrations, and everyday events that paint a vivid picture of the community over the centuries. I thought others might find these stories as interesting as I do.

## Copyright and Sources

I've tried to stay on the right side of copyright, so everything on this site has been transcribed by me directly from historical sources. The newspaper articles, census records, and other documents come from various archives and collections, and I've done my best to preserve the original text exactly as it appeared, including the occasional spelling error or archaic phrasing.

## What You'll Find Here

This site documents the history of Stanton-by-Dale through:

- **Historical Records**: Newspaper articles and documents from the 1830s onwards
- **Residents**: People who lived in or were connected to the village
- **Buildings**: Historic structures and their stories
- **Institutions**: Churches, pubs, businesses, and organizations that shaped village life

At some point I hope to add census records and correspond these to houses and residents, but this is very difficult outside of landmark properties like the pubs or grander village houses, since a number of road names have changed - Dale Road used to be known as Lillocks Road - and is named as such on the 1921 census. In addition, houses were not numbered on the 1939 register which is the last available and a number have been demolished or were built at uncertain dates, which makes finding which relate to a specific house enormously complicated.
