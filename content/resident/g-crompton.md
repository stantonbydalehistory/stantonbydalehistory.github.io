George Crompton was a landowner in Stanton-by-Dale. He employed Eli Winfield as his gamekeeper in the 1850s.

In January 1859, a case was brought before the courts for trespassing in pursuit of game on his land.

His wife, Mrs. George Crompton, resided with him at Stanton Hall in the late 19th century.
