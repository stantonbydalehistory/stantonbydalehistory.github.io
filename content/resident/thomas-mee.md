Thomas Mee was a shoemaker master in Stanton-by-Dale who employed two men.

In the 1861 census, he was recorded as an 81-year-old widower living on Stanhope Street with his son Samuel Mee (also a shoemaker) and his granddaughter Ann Thraves.

By 1887, he was described as an "aged church member" of the Wesleyan society who was "rapidly declining" in health. Thomas Towle, the musical trainer from Stapleford, made weekly visits to him during this period.
