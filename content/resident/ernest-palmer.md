Ernest Palmer was a well-known figure in Stanton-by-Dale. He worked at the Stanton Ironworks for many years and was licensee of the Seven Oaks Inn, located in the centre of the ironworks, for 11 years before his retirement.

He was an active sportsman, playing cricket and bowls for the works' teams, and later became a member of Erewash Valley Golf Club.

His wife Violet came from a family of publicans - her parents and grandparents were licensees at the White Horse in Uttoxeter.

After retiring, Ernest and Violet lived at Rose Cottage on Dale Road, Stanton-by-Dale. Sadly, Ernest died aged 69, only a month after his retirement. His funeral service was held at St. Michael's Church, Stanton-by-Dale, followed by cremation.
