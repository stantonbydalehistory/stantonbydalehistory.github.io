Rev. J. G. Howard was rector of Stanton-by-Dale, likely the same person as John Garton Howard who was instituted as vicar in 1816.

He was responsible for the restoration of St Michael's Church, being at the sole expense of the works in the chancel. The restoration was completed and the church re-opened in July 1860, though Howard was in weak health at the time and only read the offertory sentences at the re-opening service.

Earl Stanhope praised Howard's "anxious and unwearied exertions" in completing the church restoration work.

He died in 1862, and an auction sale of his furniture and effects from the Rectory was advertised in November 1862.
