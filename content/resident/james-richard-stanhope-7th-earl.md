James Richard Stanhope, 7th Earl Stanhope (9 April 1880 – 15 March 1967) was a British peer who inherited the title in 1905. He was the son of Arthur Philip Stanhope, 6th Earl Stanhope.

As a significant landowner in the Stanton-by-Dale area, he showed generosity to his tenants during the 1912 coal strike by giving permission to all his cottage tenants in Stanton and Dale to mine coal from an old open pit on Grove Farm. The coal seam was of superior quality and varied from two to three feet in thickness, providing essential fuel to the community during the strike.
