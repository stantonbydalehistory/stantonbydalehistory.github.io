Jonathan Botham was a resident of Stanton-by-Dale in the 1870s. In October 1874, he became the victim of a peculiar theft when his coat was stolen while he was dancing energetically at the Stanhope Arms. The coat was later found in a stable, and William Miller was convicted of the theft and sentenced to one month's imprisonment with hard labour at Ripley Petty Sessions.
