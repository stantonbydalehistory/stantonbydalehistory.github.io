Rev. Finlay Sanderson served as Rector of Stanton-by-Dale from 1926 to 1933, succeeding Rev. H. E. Kewley who left in August 1926.

In January 1927, he was warmly welcomed as "the new rector" at the annual Mothers' Union tea and the Choir Boys' Supper, where he attended with his wife Mrs. Sanderson. Mrs. Sanderson was actively involved in church activities, presenting book prizes to the choir boys.

After his retirement, he lived at Park Road, Dorking.

He died on December 21, 1958, aged 85, leaving substantial bequests to educational and charitable institutions including Eton College, University College Oxford, Wycliffe Hall Oxford, and various missions and charitable causes.
