Philip Henry Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope, FRS (30 January 1805 – 24 December 1875), styled Viscount Mahon between 1816 and 1855, was an English antiquarian and Tory politician. He held political office under Sir Robert Peel in the 1830s and 1840s but is best remembered for his contributions to cultural causes and for his historical writings.

As a significant landowner in the area, he granted building leases for properties in Stanton-by-Dale. In 1848, properties were being held under building leases from Earl Stanhope, including the grocery business premises tenanted by Luke Sisson.
