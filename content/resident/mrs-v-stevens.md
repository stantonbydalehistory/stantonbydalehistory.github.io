Mrs. V. Stevens was a tenant of Hall Farm in Stanton-by-Dale. 

In 1947, she was mentioned in court proceedings related to the Erewash Valley Golf Club's failure to allow cattle grazing. She had previously used parts of the golf course for grazing her cattle, but by the time the War Agricultural Committee issued its order in June 1946, she had already made other arrangements for her grazing stock and had been compelled to reduce her valuable herd.
