Rev. John M. Freshfield, M.A., was appointed to the rectory of Stanton-by-Dale, Lichfield, in January 1863 and served until October 1873, when he left for preferment (a promotion to another position).

In April 1863, he was appointed Surrogate for granting marriage licenses for the Peculiar of Dale Abbey, with Earl Stanhope as patron.

He was succeeded as vicar by Rev. W. Fox, who had previously been serving as curate and was instituted by the Bishop of Lichfield on the nomination of Earl Stanhope.
