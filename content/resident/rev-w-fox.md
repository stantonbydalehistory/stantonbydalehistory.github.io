Rev. W. Fox, M.A., served at Stanton-by-Dale first as curate and then as vicar from October 1873 to 1904, a ministry of 31 years.

In October 1873, he was instituted by the Bishop of Lichfield as vicar of Stanton-by-Dale, following the preferment (promotion) of Rev. J. M. Freshfield, M.A. The institution was on the nomination of Earl Stanhope. A year before he took up residence, the church had been restored at a cost of £1,600.

In February 1889, he was still serving as vicar and was also rural dean, though he was unable to attend a Primrose League meeting held at Stanton-by-Dale due to indisposition.

His ministry ended in 1904 after 31 years of service. The position of vicar carried with it the private chaplaincy to Earl Stanhope, the patron.
