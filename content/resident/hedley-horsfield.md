Hedley Horsfield was the landlord of the Stanhope Arms in Stanton-by-Dale from around 1975. Following in his father's footsteps (who was a landlord in Nottingham), Hedley initially trained as an engineer and worked in Stapleford before entering the pub trade. 

He and his wife Brenda undertook significant improvements to the pub, which had been in a shabby state when they took over. The pub served Shipstones beer and had its own football team, while also supporting the local bowls team. Hedley installed a television for locals to watch football matches and fostered a strong community atmosphere at the pub.
