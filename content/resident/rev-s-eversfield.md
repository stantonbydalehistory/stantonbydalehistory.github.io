Rev. S. Eversfield served as curate of Stanton-by-Dale around 1860.

In 1860, he placed a memorial window in the south side of the chancel of St Michael's Church to the memory of his mother. He officiated at the re-opening service of the church following its restoration in July 1860.

His mother was the late Mrs. Eversfield, who was noted as a contributor to the church restoration fund.
