E. J. Fox served as managing director of the Stanton Ironworks Co., Ltd. in the 1930s. He was instrumental in the company's gift of the playing field to Stanton-by-Dale village and officially opened it on May 14, 1937.

In his opening speech, he referred to the old sporting stalwarts of Stanton-by-Dale and encouraged the children to live up to the example of their elders, while paying tribute to the Parish Council and Coronation Committee.
