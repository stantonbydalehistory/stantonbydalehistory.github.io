D. R. Scattergood was the landlord of the Stanhope Arms in Stanton-by-Dale during the First World War. In January 1916, he brought charges against a Belgian refugee who had damaged property at the pub. He appears to be a different member of the Scattergood family from Richard Scattergood, who ran the pub in the late 19th century.
