George Holmes was a butcher in Stanton-by-Dale. In the 1861 census, he was recorded as 40 years old, living with his wife Elizabeth and their children Clara, Arthur, Mary, and Elin.

In February 1862, he was declared bankrupt. At the first meeting of creditors, his assets were about £20, with only one creditor proving his debt. His protection was continued until March 15th for his final examination and application for discharge.
