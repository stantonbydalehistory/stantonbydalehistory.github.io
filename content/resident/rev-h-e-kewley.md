Rev. H. E. Kewley was rector of Stanton-by-Dale Parish Church and chaplain of Dale Abbey Church from November 15th, 1905 until August 1926.

He had a distinguished career, having previously served as curate at St. Peter's Church, Derby (described as the largest and poorest parish in Derby), and was also connected with Sudbury Parish Church.

In 1926, despite struggling with continued failing health, he accepted the living of Askham in Nottinghamshire, offered by the Lord Bishop of the Diocese. He was known for acting upon principle rather than expediency, and was remembered for his genial personality, charm, and hard work. He valued "a good conscience" far more than a good name.

During his 21 years at Stanton and Dale Abbey, he nobly fulfilled his duties despite his health challenges and was well-loved by his parishioners.
