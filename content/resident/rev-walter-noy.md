Rev. Walter B. Noy was the Rector of Stanton-by-Dale in the 1950s. In 1956, he organized an ambitious joint venture with the choirs of Dale Abbey Church and Stanton-by-Dale Church to present the cantata "The City of Gold" on Good Friday, despite concerns about lost practice time due to bad weather.
