Police Constable Parfitt served the Dale Abbey and Stanton-by-Dale area in the early 1920s. In January 1922, he investigated the theft of a gun belonging to Robert Sisson, a farmer of Dale Abbey. He successfully apprehended Frederick Coombes, who had worked at Stanton Ironworks until three weeks prior to the theft. When Coombes attempted to escape, Parfitt chased and secured him.
