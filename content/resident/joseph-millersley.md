Joseph Millersley was an underviewer (mining supervisor) at Stanton Ironworks in the 1870s.

In June 1873, he brought charges against Alfred Fancourt, a contractor who had been discharged from the ironworks for being drunk and neglecting his work. Fancourt blamed Millersley for his discharge and threatened to knock off his head at Dale Abbey. Fancourt was ordered to keep the peace for six months.
