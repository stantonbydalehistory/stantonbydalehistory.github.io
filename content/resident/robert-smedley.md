Robert Smedley was born at Stanton-by-Dale around 1805 and was a boot and shoe-maker. He was one of a family of twelve sons and some daughters, all of Stanton-by-Dale, whose members included farmers, stockiners, blacksmiths, millers, bakers, and wheelwrights.

He died around 1833 at the age of 28 from an accident. According to family history, during 'plough-bullocking,' he tried to jump a canal lock. Being a very good jumper, he attempted the jump but fell short and struck his ribs on the stonework.

His son Samuel Smedley continued the family tradition as a boot and shoe-maker.
