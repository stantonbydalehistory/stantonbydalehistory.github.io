Mr. Hollingworth was a farmer at Grove Farm, Stanton-by-Dale, in the 1870s.

In October 1877, his farm experienced a significant fire when a haystack of 40-50 tons caught fire due to overheating from damp hay. The fire was attended by both Ilkeston and Derby fire brigades, marking the first fire at which the newly formed Ilkeston Fire Brigade was present.
