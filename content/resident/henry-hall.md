Henry Hall was born in Stanton, Derbyshire around 1833. In the 1861 census, he was recorded as a 28-year-old furnace labourer in iron, living with his widowed mother Maria Hall, his wife Tammy, and infant son Joseph.

He was evidently a skilled gardener, winning first prize for hand bouquets at the Stanton-by-Dale and Dale Abbey Floral and Horticultural Society exhibition in August 1898.
