Henry Hall was born in Stanton, Derbyshire around 1833. In the 1861 census, he was recorded as a 28-year-old furnace labourer in iron, living with his widowed mother Maria Hall, his wife Tammy, and infant son Joseph.

In June 1882, he was a member of the Erewash Valley Working Men's Mutual Benefit Building Society. His share No. 443 was appropriated by ballot for £150 at the annual meeting, which was then auctioned and knocked down at a premium of £53.

He was evidently a skilled gardener, winning first prize for hand bouquets at the Stanton-by-Dale and Dale Abbey Floral and Horticultural Society exhibition in August 1898.
