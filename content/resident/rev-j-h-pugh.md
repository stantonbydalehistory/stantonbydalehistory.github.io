Rev. J. H. Pugh was Rector of Westbury, Salop (Shropshire) in 1860, but had previously served as rector or curate in Stanton-by-Dale.

In July 1860, he returned to Stanton to attend the re-opening of St Michael's Church following its restoration, and delivered "a very interesting address" to his "former parishioners" at a tea attended by about 300 people.
