The Stanton-by-Dale Association for the Prosecution of Felons was a local organization dedicated to protecting property and prosecuting criminals in the parish. The association held its annual meetings at the Stanhope Arms and was willing to incur considerable expense in the detection and prosecution of offenders, including funding Assize trials for serious crimes such as burglary.
