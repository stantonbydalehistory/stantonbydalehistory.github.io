The British Legion was a veterans organization that formed a branch in Stanton-by-Dale in December 1929. Ex-service men of the village met at the Stanhope Arms to establish the branch, with officers including Mr. C. R. Crompton as president, Captain F. Cornelius as chairman, Mr. William Fryer as honorary secretary, and Mr. J. C. Storr as honorary treasurer. The branch was supported by the Ilkeston branch officials.
